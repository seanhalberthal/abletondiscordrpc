## Installation

### Prerequisites

- macOS (Intel or Apple Silicon)
- Discord running on your system
- Ableton Live 12

> **Note**: Make sure "Display current activity as a status message" is enabled in Discord Settings > Activity Privacy

### Quick Install

```bash
# Open Terminal and run the following commands to install the app. If you're not sure where to run them, you can download the repo to your desktop first.

# Run this first
git clone https://github.com/seanhalberthal/abletondiscordrpc.git

# Then copy and run these 3 together to install
cd abletondiscordrpc
sudo cp releases/ableton-discord-rpc /usr/local/bin/
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ableton-discord-rpc

# Note: you may need to enter your password for sudo access
```

### Start Using It

```bash
# Run the app
ableton-discord-rpc

# That's it! Open Ableton Live and your Discord status will update automatically
```

## Usage

### How It Works

1. **Start the app** - Run `ableton-discord-rpc` in Terminal
2. **Open Ableton Live** - Your Discord status automatically updates
3. **Customize your vibe** - Type commands to set custom status messages

### Commands

While the app is running, type these commands:

```bash
status making beats          # Set custom status
status cooking up fire       # Change your vibe
status bangers comin up      # Whatever fits your mood
quit                         # Exit the app
```

### What Your Friends See

Your Discord status will show:

- üéµ **Your project name** (e.g., "My New Track")
- üî• **Your custom status** (e.g., "making beats")
- **How long you've been working** (automatic timer)

## Technical Details

### Process Detection

- Uses `pgrep -f "Live"` to detect Ableton Live process
- Monitors process state every 15 seconds
- Automatically starts/stops session timing

### Project Name Extraction

- Retrieves window title using AppleScript
- Parses project name from "ProjectName - Ableton Live 12" format
- Falls back to "Untitled Project" if unavailable

### Discord Integration

- Uses the `rich-go` library for Discord RPC
- Implements automatic reconnection on connection failures
- Supports custom status messages via CLI commands

## Development

### Building

```bash
# Build for current platform
go build -o ableton-discord-rpc

# Build for macOS (Intel)
GOOS=darwin GOARCH=amd64 go build -o ableton-discord-rpc-intel

# Build for macOS (Apple Silicon)
GOOS=darwin GOARCH=arm64 go build -o ableton-discord-rpc-arm64
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Discord status not showing:**

- Ensure Discord is running and you're logged in
- Check that the Discord App ID assets are properly uploaded
- Verify Discord allows Rich Presence in settings

**Ableton not detected:**

- Make sure Ableton Live 12 is running
- Check that the process name contains "Live"
- Verify AppleScript permissions in System Preferences

**Project name shows as "Unknown Project":**

- Ensure Ableton Live window is active
- Check System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Accessibility
